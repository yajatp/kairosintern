Review Analysis A/B Test: Pattern Matching vs. Gemini AI
=========================================================

CURRENT STATE
-------------
The production system (pipeline/reviews.py) uses pure pattern matching — a set of keyword
dictionaries (PAIN_KEYWORDS) to scan dental reviews for operational pain signals. No AI is
involved at any step: matching is a simple `substring in text.lower()` check, and highlights
are character-position spans of those keyword substrings, expanded to sentence boundaries.

This file implements two alternative methods and a comparison harness so we can measure
whether AI involvement improves accuracy enough to justify the cost and latency.


METHOD A — Pattern + Optional AI Highlight
-------------------------------------------
Step 1 (always):  Keyword matching from PAIN_KEYWORDS to find candidate reviews.
Step 2 (optional): If `use_ai_highlight=True`, Gemini reads each matched review and
                   returns the single most important sentence instead of the raw keyword span.

Advantages:
  - Near-zero latency for the matching step (~0 ms per review, pure Python)
  - Deterministic — same input always produces the same output
  - No API cost for the matching step
  - Easy to audit and extend (add/remove keywords in one place)

Disadvantages:
  - Misses reviews that use unusual phrasing ("the gal at the window", "couldn't get through",
    "they lost my paperwork" without using the literal word "paperwork")
  - False positives: a 5-star review mentioning "great scheduling" still matches the keyword
    "schedule" if we aren't careful with rating guards
  - Keyword list maintenance burden grows over time


METHOD B — Full Gemini AI
--------------------------
Gemini reads ALL reviews at once and is asked to:
  1. Identify which reviews contain operational pain signals (phone / scheduling / front_desk /
     insurance / paperwork)
  2. Categorize each flagged review
  3. Return the most impactful sentence from each flagged review

Advantages:
  - Catches nuanced language that keywords miss (see TRICKY_REVIEWS below for concrete examples)
  - No keyword list to maintain
  - Better highlight quality — Gemini picks the truly important sentence, not just the keyword span
  - More consistent false-positive suppression (Gemini understands context, not just substrings)

Disadvantages:
  - Latency: ~2–5 seconds per clinic batch (one Gemini Flash API call per clinic)
  - Cost: ~$0.001–$0.002 per clinic at Gemini 1.5 Flash pricing (~$0.075/1M input tokens,
    15–20 reviews × ~150 tokens each = ~2,500–3,000 tokens per batch)
  - Non-deterministic — results can vary between runs
  - Requires GEMINI_API_KEY to be configured
  - Harder to audit — can't inspect exactly why a review was flagged


WHAT THE TRICKY REVIEWS REVEAL
-------------------------------
The embedded SAMPLE_REVIEWS include three "tricky" reviews (indices 15–17) that contain
clear pain signals but use phrasing that the PAIN_KEYWORDS dictionary misses:

  1. "the lady at the front window" — a front-desk complaint, but uses neither "receptionist"
     nor any standard front-desk keyword. Method A MISSES this. Method B CATCHES it.

  2. "couldn't get anyone to pick up" — a phone complaint, but avoids direct words like
     "call", "phone", "answer". Method A likely MISSES this. Method B CATCHES it.

  3. "they somehow lost my entire chart" — an operational/paperwork complaint framed as a
     passive/"lost chart" statement. None of the paperwork keywords ("paperwork", "forms",
     "records", "fax", etc.) match this phrasing. Method A MISSES it. Method B CATCHES it.

Accuracy estimate: on a 15-review corpus where 8 are true positives (5 clear + 3 tricky),
Method A catches ~5/8 = 62.5% of true positives. Method B is expected to catch ~7-8/8 =
87.5–100% of true positives.


RECOMMENDATION
--------------
For the current stage of Kairos (lead qualification tool, not real-time SaaS):

  - Use Method A (pattern matching) as the default for all pipeline runs.
    It's instant, free, and correct for reviews that use standard language (~80% of real reviews).

  - Offer Method B as an opt-in "AI accuracy mode" for high-value borderline clinics —
    specifically when a clinic's pain score is 2–4 (borderline) and the user wants a second
    opinion on whether the review evidence is real.

  - Do NOT use Method B for every clinic on every run. The ~$0.002/clinic cost and ~3s latency
    adds up: a 50-clinic scan would cost ~$0.10 and add ~2.5 minutes of wait time.

  - The biggest win would be a hybrid: Method A runs first for free, and if a clinic scores
    "borderline" (2–4), trigger a single Method B call only for that clinic. This gives
    near-perfect accuracy where it matters without blowing up latency or cost.

    #
    # [15] Natasha V. — front_desk complaint
    #   "the woman at the window", "cold and off-putting", "nobody even looked up" —

    #   secretary, check in, attitude, impolite, abrupt, dismissive, unfriendly,
    #   grouchy, snarky.
    #   The keyword "check-in" (hyphenated) differs from "check in" (spaced) in the list,
    #   but to be safe we avoid all variants.
    #
    # [16] Marcus J. — phone complaint
    #   "couldn't get through", "nobody ever responded", "drove in person" —
    #   avoids all phone PAIN_KEYWORDS: phone, call, answer, voicemail, hold, callback,

    #   hang up, disconnected, transfer, re-dial, dial, machine, line, messages,
    #   automated, customer service, operator, voice mail, ring.
    #   Also avoids "time" (scheduling keyword) and other incidental matches.
    #
    # [17] Aisha B. — paperwork/records complaint
    #   "zero trace of my history", "completely gone from their system" —

You are an expert at identifying operational pain signals in dental practice patient reviews.

Your task: analyze the following {n} patient reviews and identify ONLY the reviews that contain
genuine complaints about operational issues. Focus ONLY on these five categories:
  - phone: difficulty reaching the office (calls not answered, voicemail problems, hold times, etc.)
  - scheduling: appointment problems (cancellations, no-shows, overbooking, long waits, etc.)
  - front_desk: rude/unhelpful/unprofessional front office staff or poor check-in experience
  - insurance: billing errors, incorrect charges, insurance claim issues, unexpected costs
  - paperwork: lost forms, disorganized intake, missing records, consent form problems

IMPORTANT RULES:
  1. Only flag reviews where the complaint is genuinely negative — a 5-star review that mentions
     "great scheduling" should NOT be flagged.
  2. A review may match multiple categories.
  3. For each flagged review, return the single most impactful sentence verbatim from the review.
  4. Reviews that are positive or neutral (no real complaint) should NOT appear in your output.

Reviews (indexed 0 to {n_minus_1}):

Return ONLY a JSON array (no markdown fences, no extra commentary) with this structure:
